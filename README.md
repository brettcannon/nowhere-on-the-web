The purpose of this repository is to provide a custom [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to block "around the web"-style advertisers. This allows you to continue to support websites that have ads that are not misleading like those which are entirely linkbait with varying levels of clear labeling.

The filter list follows [uBlock Origin's static filter syntax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax) by using the [Adblock Plus format](https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet#blocking2). All rules block at the domain level.

To use the filter list, use the [raw URL of the `filter.txt` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brettcannon/nowhere-on-the-web/master/filter.txt) as a 3rd-party filter list.
